This is a prototype for a freely available online tool that can look at a chest x-ray and almost instantly tell if a child has pneumonia. It can also tell if it is bacterial or viral pneumonia.

The model was trained on chest x-rays of children aged 1 to 5. 

Model F1 score: 0.76

The process used to build and train the model is described in this Kaggle kernel:<br>
